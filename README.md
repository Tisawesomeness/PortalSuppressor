# PortalSuppressor

A simple plugin that prevents mobs from spawning in portals and instantly teleporting due to the nether spawning changes in 1.19.

Only mobs that spawn naturally or from a spawner, village, raid, patrol, or zombie reinforcement cannot spawn in portals. Spawn eggs can still spawn mobs inside portals. Any attempts to spawn a mob in a portal will fail without trying again.
